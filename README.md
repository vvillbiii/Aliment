* Project Goal:  Reverse Engineer Site we all liked. 
* Teammates: Will Bowles, Anna Nad, and KT Go
* Technologies used: HTML/CSS with Bootstrap, JavaScript with EJS Templating, Express/NodeJS. Used RESTful Routes to create CRUD functionallity.  

Key Features we chose:  
    1. Ability to CRUD Restaurants to the website
    2. CRUD Users
    3. CD Reviews

We used a TripAdvisor website as an inspiration for a NYC Resturant Interactive Directory.  We improved on the user flow by adding link to add new restaurants from home page.

We created three databases using MongoDB: 
Users, Restaurants, and Reviews. 
Users to Restaurants: Many to Many
Users to Reviews: One to Many
Restaurants to Reviews: One ot Many

We deployed our project on Heroku:
